## About Me
I have been coding for over 20 years, as well as contributing to open source
projects. Currently, I am contributing to Google Helmsman, kops, and other
things Kubernetes. I have architected critical projects with such companies as
Google, Datapipe, Accenture, Motorola, ADP, Inuit, Warner Bros, and
CenturyLink. I am most passionate about scalable open source technologies, and
not getting woken up at two in the morning because a system went boom. Outside
of work, I can be found working on OSS too much, enjoying time with my wife, or
passing on my love for the Martial Arts through Kenpo.
