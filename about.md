## About Me
I have been coding for over 20 years, as well as contributing to Opensource projects.
Currently, I am contributing to [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), K8s intro and upgrades, HA applications, and other Kubernetes designs.
I have architected critical projects with such companies as Datapipe, Accenture, Motorola, ADP, Inuit, Warner Bros, and CenturyLink.
I am most passionate about scalable open source technologies, and not getting woken up at two in the morning because a system went boom.
Outside of work, I can be found working on OSS too much, enjoying time with my wife, or passing on my love for the Martial Arts through Kenpo.
