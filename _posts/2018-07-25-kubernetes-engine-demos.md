## Where's Waldo

For the last three months my GitHub Contributions scoreboard has looked been a
ugly shade of grey.

I had one community managers for Kubernetes reach out and ask if I had been
eaten by the all encompasing XYZ.  XYZ being her company.  Yes I have been
working with an world class team with a major client on a fun, and now public,
project.  Thanks to my partners over at ReactiveOps I was given the opportunity
to work with Google Professional Services on a project that I can only call
amazingly awesome.

The team that I word with has being working hard on getting various assets ready
for #GoogleNext2018, and some of those assets include Open Source examples using
Kubernetes Engine.


## Open Source with Google Cloud Platform

As many of you know Google is a huge proponent and driver of many Open Source
projects including Kubernetes. The projects that we released on 07/25/2018
include 15 projects covering various topics focusing on using Kuberenetes Engine
on GCP, and connecting Kubernetes Engine on GCP to [Kubernetes Engine
On-Prem](https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/).  This project conincided with
the news that Google was releasing the product Kuberentes Engine On-Prem.
