kops team has released 1.7.1, which contains the required updates for kube-dns
and CVE-2017-14491. A previous post covers the details of the [CVE]({% post_url
2017-10-08-kubernetes-cve-2017-14491 %}).

You can download the kops binary from
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/tag/1.7.1).  Use this version of
kops with Kuberenetes releases 1.4.x through 1.7.x.

## Upgrading Existing Clusters

Execute the following command to upgrade `kube-dns` to the patched version.

{% highlight bash %}
kops update --name $MY_CLUSTER --yes
{% endhighlight %}

If you are running Kubernetes 1.4.x or 1.5.x, you may need to create the new
config map that `kube-dns` requires.  The kops advisory contains the [required
instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/advisories/cve_2017_14491.md#kubernetes-versions-14x---15x).  You will need to create the config map
_before_ running the kops update command.
