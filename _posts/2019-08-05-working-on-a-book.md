## What have I been up to

Besides talking some, working with some great clients, and other big personal changes, I
have not updated this blog a ton.  The time that I have had dedicated to writing has been
devoted to writing a yet unamed Kubernetes book with a co-author. My co-author, who
I shall leave unamed, and I, have been busting butt on this book, and we hope that
it will help a bunch of people operating K8s.

Will post more hopefully soon!
